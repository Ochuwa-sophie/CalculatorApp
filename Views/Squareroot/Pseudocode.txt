Pseudocode
Requirement
 can accept Two numbers and
  display which has a higher square root to the user. 

Hint: To get the square root of a user use Math.Sqrt() method.
 For example, If a user enters the numbers 4 and 16 your application should display
  "The number 16 with Square root 4 has a higher square root than the number 4 with square root 2"

If the numbers have the same square root, the system should inform the user and ask them to enter another value. 

If the value entered is not a number, an error message should be displayed for the user.

If a negative number is entered, an error message should be displayed.

 
   else
        {
    while(!double.TryParse(FirstNumber, out firstNumber))
{
    return;
}

    while(!double.TryParse(SecondNumber, out secondNumber))
{
    return;
}
        }
